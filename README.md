## Kurogane-Hammer-Mobile
KuroganeHammer.com mobile app to view character frame data offline (Android & iOS)

This project is based on the current Android app (https://github.com/rubendal/KHAndroidApp) using Xamarin Forms, which will attempt to contain all existing features on the currently released version

### Current version
Unreleased

### Status (Android)
* View frame data offline: Done
* Memes (Character/Attributes pics): Done
* Sync with KH API: Done
* Formulas: Done
* Sm4sh Calculator: Not started (not needed for release since it could have an update)

### Status (iOS)
* Still need a Mac to test, but at least it shares most code with Android so it should be the same as Android once `PlatformDependent` classes are defined on iOS project
